### Goal

To be the fastest and most easy-to-use lightweight ORM.

### Vision

To provide more flexibility and a fast-pace development approach, whether using the lightweight or heavyweight ORM operations.

### Principles

 - We will keep it as simple as possible (KISS principle)
 - We will help developers to be more focused on SOLID principles
 - We will make it as fast as possible
 - We will make it more flexible
 - We will never ever do a try-catch inside the library
 - We will never make complex implementations (specially for complex Join Queries)
